# Asah led by Dicoding in association with Accenture - Machine Learning Path Projects

Welcome to my **Asah** bootcamp repository! ðŸŽ‰

This repo contains all the coding projects and exercises I've completed during the bootcamp, where Iâ€™ve been diving deep into **Machine Learning** concepts and applications. Itâ€™s a collection of practical work showcasting what I've learned, explored, and built throughout the program.
